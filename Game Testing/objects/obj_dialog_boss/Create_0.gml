Before, we could maybe rob a few dozen cats a day, get a few more hooked on catnip. Now, we can roll hundreds of them in an hour! And the best part is, they hand over their wallets willingly, chasing the dream of winning big. Join us, Louie. You know that the Doghouse always wins.\" He offered his paw. The goons lowered their guns.");
