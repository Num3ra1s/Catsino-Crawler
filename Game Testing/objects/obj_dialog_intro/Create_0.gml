dialog.add(spr_dialog_louie, "The rain beat down, smoky and black, pooling in the street. All I had to my name was twenty catnip cigarettes, my trusty .38 magnum Fortuna, and my ninth life. How long could I hold onto the last? I lit a cig and took a drag, warming my lungs and my cold, cold heart.");
dialog.add(spr_dialog_louie, "A shadow fell across me. I spun and leveled Fortuna at it. My cigarette hissed as it fell into a puddle. Damn. Nineteen now.");

dialog.add(spr_dialog_shadow, "\"You want your lives back, nya? I can help you steal them from the Dog Mafia.\" It was curling back lips it didn\'t have to show me teeth it shouldn\'t have. \"They\'re locked in a safe in the Dogfather\'s penthouse, all eight of \'em! And in return, well... let\'s just say that I\'ll take my due from the top dog.\"");

I ain\'t exactly subtle, and Fortuna here doesn\'t have the punch to get past them to grab the three keys I\'d need to unlock the elevator.\"");
dialog.add(spr_dialog_shadow, "\"Oh, I can help you with that!~\" It plucked Fortuna from my cold paws and blew a breath of smoke over it. When I blinked away the tears, the chamber was gone, replaced by a whirling twenty-sided die. Like the ones nerds use.");
