dialog.add(spr_dialog_louie, "I threw open the lockbox door, key still in the lock, and snatched the little IOU notes that fluttered out. As I shredded them with my claws, I felt my lives flow back into me. I may have stumbled a bit along the road, but the cards always come up Louie Nine-Lives.");

In the glass of the skyscraper across the street, the reflection of the casino was transformed. Instead of a solid doghouse, it was a branched cat tree. I read the name backwards: \"Catsino.\"");
